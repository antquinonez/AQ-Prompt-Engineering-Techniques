# AQ-Prompt-Engineering-Techniques

## Introduction
Prompt Engineering is a super power. It makes developers more productive and it can empower all sorts of creators to bring their visions to reality. Or just make us better at our jobs. In this repository, I'll be gathering (and inventing?) a set of useful techniques and workflows for gaining incredible benefits from tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. As a new field, I'm excited to see what will emerge from all this exploration.

## About ChatGPT
All tedhniques, so far, has been written using ChatGPT-4.

## About Bard
Bard does not use public versioning yet.

### Observations
- 4/8/2023: I could not get a valid method to append records to a pandas dataframe. The variations on a solution involved using append, which is no longer a valid method. It's pulling old information from the internet. And dang, did it not train on enough GitHub? I hope bard is not a non-starter or a narrowly useful tool for too long.

## Library Layout
The library is organized into two main folders, GPT and Bard, depending on which tool was used to document a technique. Regardless, it's possible and likely that a technique will work for both.

# Table of Contents
I have the following folders/topics:
- Basic: Of the interesting, should of thought of that myself variety.
- Multi-Step: Multiple-step techniques.
- Refactorings: For example, of the turning functions into classes variety.
- Code Complete: Inspired by the book Code Complete by Steve McConnell, who provides dozens of useful practices. This is my homage to him. I don't know if my code completes are in Steve's book...but maybe. I definitely learned a lot from that book.

## Note on the use of Jupyter Notebooks
Unless stated otherwise, the Jupyter notebooks are not executable. My intention is for people to be able to utilize these techniques in whatever way works best for them, be it through a web browser, a REST API, a Python library, or any other method that may arise.

I find Jupyter particularly useful for its ability to display both code and non-code (text), so I use it here.

## Coming Soon
Ars longa, vita brevis

## Note on Style
I prefer adopting a first-person, conversational tone that's nonetheless concise and accurate. I hope this approach works for you.

## Contributions
Please feel free to create branches and contribute with fixes, new techniques, or anything else you'd like to add!

## Conclusion
As ChatGPT has said,

> Stay curious, collaborate openly, embrace challenges, and most importantly, believe in your collective power to create awesomeness. Now go out there and make a difference!
