# AQ-Prompt-Engineering-Techniques

## Introduction
Prompt Engineering is a super power. It empowers all sorts of creators to bring their visions to reality. In this repository, I'll be gathering (and inventing?) a set of useful techniques and workflows for using tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. While my theme, for now, is software development the principles here should be applicable to other subjects and models as well.

## About ChatGPT
Most ChatGPT techniques have been written using ChatGPT-4. While, the same techniques can provide similar results for earlier versions of ChatGPT, the results will be less impressive. Sometimes, though, that's a good thing because the less advanced model will more readily reveal the weaknesses of an approach.

## About Bard
Bard's limitations as a code generator are highly illustrative for prompt engineering. You can very quickly find yourself generating the wrong answer after the correct answer had been previously generated. Bard is weighing the latest answer heavier than the previous correct answer and can't get unstuck.

### Notes
- 4/8/2023: I could not get a valid method to append records to a pandas dataframe. The variations on a solution involved using append, which is no longer a valid method. It's pulling old information from the internet. And dang, did it not train on enough GitHub? I hope Bard is not a non-starter or a narrowly useful tool for too long.

## The Library
## Library Layout
The library is organized into two main folders, GPT and Bard, depending on which tool was used to document a technique. Regardless, it's possible and likely that a technique will work for both.

## Table of Contents
I have the following folders/topics:
- Basic: Of the, "Interesting, should of thought of that myself variety". Not to be confused with the, "I wish I had known this before I started" variety" (see below)
- Best Practice: Of the, "I wish I had known this before I started" variety". These are fundamental approaches. I recommend reviewing this first.
- Multi-Step: Multiple-step techniques. Things that you can and probably should spread out overt multiple steps.
- Refactorings: For example, of the turning functions into classes variety.
- Code Complete: Inspired by the book Code Complete by Steve McConnell, who provides dozens of useful practices. This is my homage to him. I don't know if my code completes are in Steve's book...but maybe. I definitely learned a lot from that book.

## Other Content
- Glossary: A glossary of terms and definitions.
- [Wiki](/wiki): Analysis and summaries of the techniques in this repo.

## Note on the use of Jupyter Notebooks
Unless stated otherwise, the Jupyter notebooks are not executable. My intention is for people to be able to utilize these techniques in whatever way works best for them, be it through a web browser, a REST API, a Python library, or any other method that may arise.

I find Jupyter particularly useful for its ability to display both code and non-code (text), so I use it here.

## Coming Soon
Ars longa, vita brevis.

## Note on Style
I prefer adopting a first-person, conversational tone that's nonetheless concise and accurate. I hope this approach works for you.

## Contributions
Please feel free to create branches and contribute with fixes, new techniques, or anything else you'd like to add!

## Conclusion
As ChatGPT has said,

> Stay curious, collaborate openly, embrace challenges, and most importantly, believe in your collective power to create awesomeness. Now go out there and make a difference!
